// A lightweight WebSocket-framework.
// Golem simplifies interaction with websockets by exposing an event-based system allowing
// easy prototyping of WebSocket-interaction. To achieve this a simple extendable JSON-based
// protocol is used, that is marshalled automatically into the desired types through reflection.
//
// Examples can be found in the example repository:
// https://github.com/trevex/golem_examples
package golem
